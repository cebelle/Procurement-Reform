Case studies and final report on procurement reform project.

PROCUREMENT REFORM RESEARCH PROEJCT 2014
AUTHOR: CHARLES BELLE
DATE: COMPELTED 6/2014

BACKGROUND

Procurement, by local and state government in the United States is estimated at $1.5 trillion per year. Efforts to reform this process invoke a complicated and multilayered set of issues that include modifying regulations, reconstructing agency culture, and developing new technical solutions. As a first step in this process, Code for America, supported by a grant from the Omidyar Network, launched a research project in Spring of 2014. The research project consisted of interviewing six cities that recently launched procurement reform projects. The purpose of these interviews was twofold: to elicit lessons for further study and identify practices to share with other cities.
